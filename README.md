# Work Day-Planner

## Description

I made this simple work day schedule app to help me keep track of my work day on an hourly basis. Before this app, I was writing everything on sticky notes and constantly getting everything all turned around. I learned a lot about using the data attribute. I hadn't really used data before but I decided to learn more about it and use that to help set the backround color of schedule events based on the time of day.

## Usage

The page has text areas for each hour of the working day. Once you type something for that hour of the day, click the save icon on the far right of that hour's section. Your notes will be saved and you can leave the page and come back to them later.

Try writing in some things for your daily schedule, saving it, then leaving the page and coming back: see if your schedule is still there!
